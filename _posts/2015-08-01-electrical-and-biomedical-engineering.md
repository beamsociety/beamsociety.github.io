The Biomedical Engineering Option in Electrical Engineering allows students interested in the application of technology to medicine and the life sciences to have a course and project concentration in these areas. The option provides core courses in Electrical Engineering as well as a broad range of specific courses traditionally covered in Biomedical Engineering: anatomy, physiology, biomedical instrumentation, biosignals and systems, medical imaging, regulatory standards, design processes and the emerging areas of micro and nanotechnology. No previous training or courses in biology or medicine are required. <sup>[[reference]](https://www.ece.ubc.ca/academic-programs/undergraduate/programs/biomedical-engineering-option)</sup>
