BEAMS and the iBiomed Society have invited Dr. Todd Hoare for our first Lecture Series of the school year! Dr. Hoare will be talking about the applications of hydro-gels in medicine.

Dr. Todd Hoare is an Associate Professor in the Department of Chemical Engineering at McMaster University. He leads the Hoare Lab which explores the rational design of “smart” hydrogel-based materials.

Come out and learn about the applications of biomedical engineering to real life! Light refreshments will be provided.
