A common ambition of many **BEAMS** students is to finish their undergraduate degree and go on to attend medical school. Join us on Wednesday, September 16th to find out more about med school with *Hamzah Qureshi*, a **BEAMS alumni** who is currently in his fourth year of medical school at the *University of Toronto*.

Hamzah will be discussing his path to medical school from a degree in Electrical and Biomedical Engineering, as well as answering questions current BEAMS students may have, so bring your questions to ask! 

Event will be held in BSB 104 at 6:30 pm.
