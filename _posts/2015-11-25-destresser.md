It’s that time of year again, when stress is upon us and feelings of anxiety abound. But fear not! BEAMS is planning a night of holiday fun and relaxation to help you unwind after you’ve finally finished those pesky midterms. Come join us on Wednesday December 2 in BSB 119 for a night to destress before we inevitably need to buckle down to study for finals.

Our relaxing and stress-free night will include:

- Movies and popcorn
- Gingerbread cookie decoration
- Hot chocolate
- Holiday-themed colouring pages
- Making snowflakes
- Board games

Come for free food, stay for great friends, and a night of good old-fashioned fun!
