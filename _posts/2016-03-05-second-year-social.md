The school year is winding to a close, and what better way to celebrate it than with your fellow **BEAMS** members? We will be hosting a second year social in the basement room of [Ye Olde Squire](http://www.yeoldesquire.ca/) (where Kelseys on Main St. used to be located!) for everyone to come hang out. There will be **FREE FOOD** for you all to enjoy!
