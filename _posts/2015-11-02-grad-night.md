Interested in graduate studies in bioengineering, biomedical, or biotechnology, but just don't what it's about? Come out to the popular GRAD NIGHT event hosted by BEAMS. 

This is a great opportunity to ask graduate students questions and figure out the inner workings of research and university life. 

COME ASK QUESTIONS! ASK GRAD STUDENTS ABOUT THEIR RESEARCH! LEARN ABOUT GRAD SCHOOL!

But most importantly, come over to have some free pizza and make a friend!

###### *Just a note that this event is geared towards bioenigneering, biomedical engineering, and biotechnology students (if you're interested in those fields, it is encouraged that you come out).*
