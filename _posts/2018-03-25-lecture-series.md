Dr. Grandfield will be talking about designing and characterizing new biomaterials for orthopedics and dentistry and the new technologies for modifying or producing new biomaterials for these applications, and the methods taken to evaluate them.
Dr. Kathryn Grandfield is an Assistant Professor in the Department of Materials Science & Engineering and School of Biomedical Engineering at McMaster University, where she leads the Grandfield Research Group. 
This will be a unique opportunity to learn how biomedical engineering makes an impact within our world. We hope to see you there!

Event will be held in ETB 124 on Tuesday, March 27th at 6:30 pm.
