These are the basic courses to take while in high school to make your way into first year engineering at McMaster University. 

6 Grade 12 U/M Courses, including:

- English (ENG4U)
- Calculus and Vectors (MCV4U)
- Chemistry (SCH4U)
- Physics (SPH4U)

###### Note: Taking Biology (SBI4U) in High School, although not mandatory for acceptance into Engineering at McMaster or a BioEngineering stream, is recommended, as it will give you a headstart on some topics!
