The Bioengineering at McMaster Society (BEAMS) and Undergraduate Student Research in Engineering (USRE) present to you GRAD NIGHT.
The event will consist of the following:

1. A presentation from USRE on how to get involved with undergraduate research, and how to apply to graduate school.
2. Current Masters and PhD students giving talks on their own bioengineering-related graduate research. 
3. An open Q&A with graduate students - your chance to ask them anything, from graduate student lifestyle, their path to graduate studies, etc.! They want to answer your questions!

We hope to see you there! Free, light refreshments will be provided. Please come for 6:50pm to ensure that you get a spot + refreshments!
