You'll have an opportunity to hear a 5 minute presentation about the programs, including the kinds of courses you'll take, career opportunities, and more! 
After, we'll have some casual networking where you can meet the upper students in each program and ask any questions you want, and get a first hand view at our thoughts about the programs! We'll also be serving FREE SNACKS at this time!


Time: March 20th, 2017 at 6:30pm
Place: ABB 163 - McMaster University
